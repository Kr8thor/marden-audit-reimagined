2. **Fixed SPA Routing for Netlify**
   - Added `_redirects` file in `/public` and `/dist`
   - Updated `netlify.toml` with correct redirect rules

3. **Verified Component Structure**
   - Confirmed enhanced components are properly created
   - Verified import paths are correct
   - Ensured routes are properly set up in `App.tsx`

4. **Created Comprehensive Deployment Scripts**
   - Created `netlify-complete-deploy.bat` for reliable deployment
   - Built with production environment variables

5. **Added Documentation**
   - Created verification guide for post-deployment checks
   - Documented environment variable setup

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Netlify Drop Deployment**
   - Drag the entire `dist` folder to Netlify Drop
   - Set up environment variables in Netlify dashboard
   - Trigger a new deployment

2. **Verify Enhanced Features**
   - Navigate to `/enhanced-analyzer`
   - Test schema validation and mobile-friendliness analysis

3. **Set Up Custom Domain**
   - Configure `audit.mardenseo.com` in Netlify dashboard

## Backend API Integration

The enhanced features require these backend endpoints:
- `/schema-analyze`
- `/mobile-analyze`
- `/enhanced-seo-analyze`

Ensure the backend is properly configured to handle these requests.
